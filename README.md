# STOCK-MARKET-ANALYSIS

The **Stock Market Analysis and Prediction** project is focused on the technical analysis, visualization, and prediction of stock market data using Python. The project especially looks at big tech stocks like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google by utilizing data from Google Finance. The project entails importing financial data, evaluating historical performance, and visualizing important indicators including closing prices, trading volumes, and daily returns using tools like {NumPy`, `Pandas}, and `Matplotlib}. The project's use of the Monte Carlo method to forecast future stock values is a key component that highlights the significance of risk analysis and the relationship between various stocks. Jupyter Notebook, an environment perfect for data-driven tasks like cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling, was used to accomplish the project. Although the examination discovered no conclusive evidence of predictive value from fundamental analysis metrics, the focus shifted towards predicting daily market trends, highlighting the challenges and future scope in stock market prediction.
